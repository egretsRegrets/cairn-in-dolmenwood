# Character Creation Summary

## Acronyms

Character creation in this Cairn + Dolmenwood game requires frequent recourse to two books: the Cairn 2e Players Guide and the Dolmenwood Players Book.
From here on out

- the _Cairn 2e Players Guide_ is referred to as the **CPG**.
- the _Dolmenwood Players Book_ is referred to as the **DPB**
  If these books haven't been provided to you or you can't find them, please ask Sam.

## Background & Starting Items

Roll or Choose a background as outlined on pg. 8 of the CPG; _do not_ select a character name from your background—unless you see one you really like. Your background will include your starting gear and two background-unique tables, which will fill out your character's history and add additional starting items.

- All PCs start with a backpack, which does not take up a slot

## Attributes, and Hit Protection

Roll your Attributes and Hit Protection. In the character sheet, HP _and_ Attributes will all have a Total and Current value; when creating your character these values will be the same. For more info on Attributes see CPG pg. 9 & 62.

- Roll 3d6 for each of your attributes, in order: Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), and Willpower (WIL).
  - You may swap any two results.
- Roll 1d6 to determine your PC’s starting Hit Protection (HP), which reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat.

## Kindred

### Pick or Roll a Kindred

For more information on Kindred see DPB pg. 30-31 (additional info pg. 32-53). Kindred will be treated as mechanically identical but each belong to a unique cultural context within Dolmenwood and may have very different starting _beliefs_ and _desires_ according to those cultures.

### Kindred Specific Details

#### Age

The first page of each Kindred detail section in the DPB includes a formula for determining _level 1 PC Age_. Use this formula to determine your PCs starting age.

#### Starting Languages

Each PC begins with working knowledge of two languages: Woldish—the common tongue in Dolmenwood—and a language common to that PC's kindred. Most Humans in Dolmenwood only know Woldish; Human PCs will begin with Woldish and one additional random language.

| Kindred   | Starting Languages              |
| --------- | ------------------------------- |
| Breggle   | Woldish, Gaffe                  |
| Elf       | Woldish, High Elfish            |
| Grimalkin | Woldish, Mewl                   |
| Human     | Woldish, random—see table below |
| Mossling  | Woldish, Mulch                  |
| Woodgrue  | Woldish, Sylvan                 |

##### Random Language (for Human PCs)

| d6  | Languages   | Notes                                  |
| --- | ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Dwelve      | Common tongue of Dolmenwood underworld |
| 2-3 | Gaffe       | Breggle common tongue                  |
| 4   | Liturgic    | Pluritine Church scriptural tongue     |
| 5   | Old Woldish | Ancient language                       |
| 6   | Sylvan      | Demi-fey common tongue                 |

#### Roll, Choose or Make Up a name

The first page of each Kindred detail section in the DPB includes a d20 list of names, as well as a paragraph describing how members of that kindred are named or use names; some kindred list Male, Female and Unisex first names, while others group names by different conventions.
Roll, choose or make up a name. If you're having trouble deciding your character's name, each Background in the CPG contains a list of names which you may use if you prefer.

### Failed Career, Trinket, Personality, and Appearance

The last two pages of each Kindred detail section in the DPB feature several tables which can be used to flesh out your PC's history, appearance, and personality.These are largely optional and inspirational, however three of these are more important and shouldn't be skipped\*: be sure to roll the following:

1. Kindred Background: the cell for this in the character sheet has the header Failed Career; it's the job you had before your career in adventuring began
2. Kindred Trinket: a kindred-unique starting item; add this to your inventory
3. Desires: the goal your PC has been working toward, or is desirous of, at the beginning of the campaign
   The rest of these additional starting details can be added to the Traits section of the character sheet

\*The hope is that these three starting details—Failed Career, Trinket and Desires—serve to take the place of the Cairn 2e Bonds
